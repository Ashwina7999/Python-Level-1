'''
Write a program that given three integers A, B and K, print the number of integerswithin the range [A-B] that are divisible by K

For example, for A=6, B=11, and K=2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the
range [6...11], namely 6, 8 and 10

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
A and B are the integers within the range [0...2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1....2,000,000,000];
A<=B


TEST CASE 1:
5
15
6

OUTPUT:
2
