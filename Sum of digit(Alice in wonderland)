Alice was bored those days, so she was sitting on the riverbank. suddenly she notices a talking, white rabbit with a pocket
watch. it ran fast and she followed it, down a rabbit hole. she fell into the hole and found a magical wonderland with dark
trees, beautiful flowers. she found many ways numbered from 1,2,3,.....18. she was confused which is the right way that will 
lead her to her home. she found a cute bird, standing in one of the trees. Alice asked the bird for the way to go back to her home. 
The bird said a two-digit number(say 23) and asked her to find the sum of its digits(2+3=5) and that numbered way will lead
her to her home. For any other input, it should print "Invalid Input". Alice was already confused. Please help Alice in finding
the route to her home.
